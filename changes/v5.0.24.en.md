# v5.0.24

## Enhancements

- [#10457](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10457) Deprecates the integration with StatsD.

  Since StatsD is not used a lot. So we will deprecate it in the next release
  and plan to remove it in 5.1

- [#10458](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10458) Set the level of plugin configuration options to low level,
  in most cases, users only need to manage plugins on the dashboard
  without the need for manual modification, so we lowered the level.



## Bug Fixes

- [#10407](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10407) Improve 'emqx_alarm' performance by using Mnesia dirty operations and avoiding
  unnecessary calls from 'emqx_resource_manager' to reactivate alarms that have been already activated.
  Use new safe 'emqx_alarm' API to activate/deactivate alarms to ensure that emqx_resource_manager
  doesn't crash because of alarm timeouts.
  The crashes were possible when the following conditions co-occurred:
  - a relatively high number of failing resources, e.g. bridges tried to activate alarms on re-occurring errors;
  - the system experienced a very high load.

- [#10420](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10420) Fix HTTP path handling when composing the URL for the HTTP requests in authentication and authorization modules.
  * Avoid unnecessary URL normalization since we cannot assume that external servers treat original and normalized URLs equally. This led to bugs like [#10411](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/issues/10411).
  * Fix the issue that path segments could be HTTP encoded twice.

- [#10422](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10422) Fixed a bug where external plugins could not be configured via environment variables in a lone-node cluster.

- [#10448](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10448) Fix a compatibility issue of limiter configuration introduced by v5.0.23 which broke the upgrade from previous versions if the `capacity` is `infinity`.

  In v5.0.23 we have replaced `capacity` with `burst`. After this fix, a `capacity = infinity` config will be automatically converted to equivalent `burst = 0`.

- [#10449](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10449) Validate the ssl_options and header configurations when creating authentication http (`authn_http`).
  Prior to this, incorrect `ssl` configuration could result in successful creation but the entire authn being unusable.

- [#10455](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10455) Fixed an issue that could cause (otherwise harmless) noise in the logs.

  During some particularly slow synchronous calls to bridges, some late replies could be sent to connections processes that were no longer expecting a reply, and then emit an error log like:

  ```
  2023-04-19T18:24:35.350233+00:00 [error] msg: unexpected_info, mfa: emqx_channel:handle_info/2, line: 1278, peername: 172.22.0.1:36384, clientid: caribdis_bench_sub_1137967633_4788, info: {#Ref<0.408802983.1941504010.189402>,{ok,200,[{<<"cache-control">>,<<"max-age=0, ...">>}}
  ```

  Those logs are harmless, but they could flood and worry the users without need.

- [#10463](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10463) Improve bridges API error handling.
  If Webhook bridge URL is not valid, bridges API will return '400' error instead of '500'.
