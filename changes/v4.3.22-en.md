# v4.3.22

## Enhancements

- Support to use placeholders like `${var}` in the HTTP `Headers` of rule-engine's Webhook actions [#9239](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9239).

- Asynchronously refresh the resources and rules during emqx boot-up [#9199](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9199).
  This is to avoid slowing down the boot if some resources spend long time establishing the connection.

- Add a warning log if the ACL check failed for subscription [#9124](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9124).
  This is to make the ACL deny logging for subscription behave the same as for publish.

- JWT ACL claim supports `all` action to imply the rules applie to both `pub` and `sub` [#9044](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9044).

- Added a log censor to avoid logging sensitive data [#9189](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9189).
  If the data to be logged is a map or key-value list which contains sensitive key words such as `password`, the value is obfuscated as `******`.

- Enhanced log security in ACL modules, sensitive data will be obscured. [#9242](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9242).

- Add `dashboard.bootstrap_users_file` configuration to bulk import default administrative username and password when EMQX initializes the database [#9256](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9256).

- Support delayed and retained messages deletion after a client is banned [#9257](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9257).
  Added a new configuration field `clean_when_banned` (default value is `false`), when set to `true`, the delayed and retained messages will be cleaned up when the client is banned with its clientid.

## Bug fixes

- Fix that after uploading a backup file with an UTF8 filename, HTTP API `GET /data/export` fails with status code 500 [#9224](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9224).

- Improve the display of rule's 'Maximum Speed' counter to only reserve 2 decimal places [#9185](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9185).
  This is to avoid displaying floats like `0.30000000000000004` on the dashboard.

- Fix the issue that emqx prints too many error logs when connecting to mongodb but auth failed [#9184](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9184).

- Fix that after receiving publish in `idle mode` the emqx-sn gateway may panic [#9024](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9024).

- "Pause due to rate limit" log level demoted from warning to notice [#9134](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9134).

- Restore old `emqx_auth_jwt` module API, so the hook callback functions registered in older version will not be invalidated after hot-upgrade [#9144](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9144).

- Fixed the response status code for the `/status` endpoint [#9210](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9210).
  Before the fix, it always returned `200` even if the EMQX application was not running.  Now it returns `503` in that case.

- Fix message delivery related event encoding [#9226](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9226)
  For rule-engine's input events like `$events/message_delivered`, and `$events/message_dropped`,
  if the message was delivered to a shared-subscription, the encoding (to JSON) of the event will fail.
  Affected versions: `v4.3.21`, `v4.4.10`, `e4.3.16` and `e4.4.10`.

- Make sure Rule-Engine API supports Percent-encoding `rule_id` and `resource_id` in HTTP request path [#9190](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9190).
  Note that the `id` in `POST /api/v4/rules` should be literals (not encoded) when creating a `rule` or `resource`.
