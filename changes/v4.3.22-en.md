# v4.3.22

## Enhancements


- Make sure listener's `tls_versions` config value is one or more of `tlsv1`, `tlsv1.1`, `tlsv1.2`, `tlsv1.3` [#9260](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9260).

- Remove useless information from the dashboard listener failure log [#9260](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9260).

- We now trigger the `'message.acked'` hook after the CoAP gateway sends a message to the device and receives the ACK from the device [#9264](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9264).
  With this change, the CoAP gateway can be combined with the offline message caching function (in the
  emqx enterprise), so that CoAP devices are able to read the missed messages from the database when
  it is online again.

- Support to use placeholders like `${var}` in the HTTP `Headers` of rule-engine's Webhook actions [#9239](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9239).

- Asynchronously refresh the resources and rules during emqx boot-up [#9199](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9199).
  This is to avoid slowing down the boot if some resources spend long time establishing the connection.

- Add a warning log if the ACL check failed for subscription [#9124](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9124).
  This is to make the ACL deny logging for subscription behave the same as for publish.

- JWT ACL claim supports `all` action to imply the rules applie to both `pub` and `sub` [#9044](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9044).

- Added a log censor to avoid logging sensitive data [#9189](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9189).
  If the data to be logged is a map or key-value list which contains sensitive key words such as `password`, the value is obfuscated as `******`.

- Enhanced log security in ACL modules, sensitive data will be obscured [#9242](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9242).

- Add `management.bootstrap_apps_file` configuration to bulk import default app/secret when EMQX initializes the database [#9273](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9273).

- Added two new configs for deterministic order of authentication and ACL checks [#9283](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9283).
  The two new global config names are `auth_order` and `acl_order`.
  When multiple ACL or auth plugins (or modules) are enabled, without this config, the order (in which each backend is queried)
  is determined by the start/restart order of the plugin (or module).
  Meaning, if a plugin (or module) is restarted after initial boot, it may get ordered to the end of the list.
  With this config, you may set the order with a comma-speapated ACL or auth plugin names (or aliases).
  For example: `acl_order = jwt,http`, this will make sure `jwt` is always checked before `http`,
  meaning if JWT is not found (or no `acl` cliam) for a client, then the ACL check will fallback to use the HTTP backend.

- Added configurations to enable more `client.disconnected` events (and counter bumps) [#9267](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9267).
  Prior to this change, the `client.disconnected` event (and counter bump) is triggered when a client
  performs a 'normal' disconnect, or is 'kicked' by system admin, but NOT triggered when a
  stale connection had to be 'discarded' (for clean session) or 'takeovered' (for non-clean session) by new connection.
  Now it is possible to set configs `broker.client_disconnect_discarded` and `broker.client_disconnect_takeovered` to `on` to enable the event in these scenarios.

- For Rule-Engine resource creation failure, delay before the first retry [#9313](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9313).
  Prior to this change, the retry delay was added *after* the retry failure.

## Bug fixes

- Fix that after uploading a backup file with an non-ASCII filename, HTTP API `GET /data/export` fails with status code 500 [#9224](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9224).

- Improve the display of rule's 'Maximum Speed' counter to only reserve 2 decimal places [#9185](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9185).
  This is to avoid displaying floats like `0.30000000000000004` on the dashboard.

- Fix the issue that emqx prints too many error logs when connecting to mongodb but auth failed [#9184](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9184).

- Fix that after receiving publish in `idle mode` the emqx-sn gateway may panic [#9024](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9024).

- "Pause due to rate limit" log level demoted from warning to notice [#9134](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9134).

- Restore old `emqx_auth_jwt` module API, so the hook callback functions registered in older version will not be invalidated after hot-upgrade [#9144](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9144).

- Avoid crash logs in CoAP gateway when receiving liveness checking packets from Load Balancer [#9118](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9118).

- Fixed the response status code for the `/status` endpoint [#9210](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9210).
  Before the fix, it always returned `200` even if the EMQX application was not running.  Now it returns `503` in that case.

- Fix message delivery related event encoding [#9226](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9226)
  For rule-engine's input events like `$events/message_delivered`, and `$events/message_dropped`,
  if the message was delivered to a shared-subscription, the encoding (to JSON) of the event will fail.
  Affected versions: `v4.3.21`, `v4.4.10`, `e4.3.16` and `e4.4.10`.

- Make sure Rule-Engine API supports Percent-encoding `rule_id` and `resource_id` in HTTP request path [#9190](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9190).
  Note that the `id` in `POST /api/v4/rules` should be literals (not encoded) when creating a `rule` or `resource`.
  See docs [Create Rule](https://www.emqx.io/docs/zh/v4.3/advanced/http-api.html#post-api-v4-rules) [Create Resource](https://www.emqx.io/docs/zh/v4.3/advanced/http-api.html#post-api-v4-resources).

- Calling 'DELETE /alarms/deactivated' now deletes deactived alarms on all nodes, including remote nodes, not just the local node [#9280](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9280).

- When republishing messages or bridge messages to other brokers, check the validity of the topic and make sure it does not have topic wildcards [#9291](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9291).

- Disable authorization for `api/v4/emqx_prometheus` endpoint on management api listener (default 8081) [#9294](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9294).
