Address a few shortcomings in the DS Raft backend implementation:
1. Shard membership changes now proceed in rare cases where the current shard replica set consists solely of replicas on "lost" sites, i.e. corresponding to nodes that previously left the cluster.
2. The _Forget site_ operation now has additional safeguards and will fail if the site is part of active shard replica sets or if its corresponding node remains in the cluster.
