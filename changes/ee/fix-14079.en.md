Fix Kafka consumer latency issue when partitions share the same partition leader in Kafka.

When fetching from a Kafka partition leader, the request is blocked until the previously sent fetch requests have returned.
This is because Kafka only serves one inflight fetch request at a time, it causes a head-of-line blocking if there happends to be more than one partitions sharing the same parition leader broker.
The fix in this change is to make sure partition consumers create their own TCP connection to the partition leader.
