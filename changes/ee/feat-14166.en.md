The `exchange` and `routing_key` in RabbitMQ producer can be configured as template values.
For example, to extract the routing key from the payload, we could set "routing_key" to "${payload.akey}".

Note, the templated `exchange` and `routing_key` are restricted in batch mode: We always assume that the value of them is the same for every message in a batch.
