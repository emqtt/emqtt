Internally, the Kafka Producer bridge type has been renamed from `kafka` to `kafka_producer`.

This is to improve consistency (compare to `kafka_consumer`). This should only concern users that write their configuration files by hand (`emqx.conf` or `cluster.hocon`), and is an otherwise transparent change.
