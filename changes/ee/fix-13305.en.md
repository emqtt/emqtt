Improved error handling for Redis connectors. Previously, Redis connectors of type single or sentinel would always encounter a timeout error during the connector test in the dashboard if no username or password was provided. This update ensures that users now receive an informative error message in such scenarios. Additionally, more detailed error information has been added for all Redis connector types to enhance diagnostics and troubleshooting.
