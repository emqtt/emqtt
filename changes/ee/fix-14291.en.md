Upgraded Pulsar producer driver to fix handling of `Redirect` `LookupType` responses when looking up a topic in Pulsar.

Before this fix, if the `LookupType` response type was `Redirect` when (re)starting a producer, it would incorrectly attempt to connect to the returned broker and fail to publish any messages.  Example logs under such condition:

```
2024-11-25T20:40:54.140659+00:00 [error] [pulsar-producer][persistent://public/default/p3-partition-0] Response error:'ServiceNotReady', msg:"Namespace bundle for topic (persistent://public/default/p3-partition-0) not served by this instance. Please redo the lookup. Request is denied: namespace=public/default"
```
