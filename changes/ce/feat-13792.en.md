The `GET /banned` endpoint supports querying using filters in the query string.
The available filters are:
- clientid
- username
- peerhost
- like_clientid
- like_username
- like_peerhost
- like_peerhost_net

## Breaking changes
* The default expiration time for a banned item that is created without an `until` value is now `infinity` up from 1 year.
