Fixed multiple issues with the Stomp gateway, including:
- Fixed an issue where `is_superuser` was not working correctly.
- Fixed an issue where the mountpoint was not being removed in message delivery.
- After a message or subscription request fails, the Stomp client should be disconnected
  immediately after replying with an ERROR message.
