Add a startup timeout limit for the plug-in application. Currently the timeout is 10 seconds.

Starting a bad plugin while EMQX is running will result in a thrown runtime error.
When EMQX is closed and restarted, the main starting process may hang due to the the plugin application to start failures.

This may happen in the following cases:
- After closing EMQX, the EMQX's configuration file is changed, and make the bad plugin is configured to enable.
- After closing EMQX, the Plugin's configuration file is changed, so that the plugin cannot be started with the bad configuration file.
