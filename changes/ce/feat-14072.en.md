Changed the virtual machine printable range to unicode.  This means that some binaries that previously had their byte representation printed in message will now be better formatted.  For example, a binary that was once formatted as `<<116,101,115,116,228,184,173,230,150,135>>` will now be formatted as `<<"test中文"/utf8>>`.
