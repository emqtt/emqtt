Reduce CPU usage by idle durable sessions.

Previously idle durable sessions had to wake up periodically to refresh the list of DS streams.
This change makes stream discovery event-based.
Additionally, it reduces the delay before the sessions are made aware of new streams, removing the long tail from the end-to-end latency distribution.
