Removed an error level log when failed to validate UTF-8 strings in MQTT messages:

```
{"time":"2024-10-11T06:05:07.610048+00:00","level":"error","msg":"supervisor: {esockd_connection_sup,0.53591191.0}, errorContext: connection_shutdown, reason: #{cause => invalid_topic,reason => malformed_utf8_string_length}, offender: [{pid,0.53591191.0},...]", ..., "error_logger":{"type":"supervisor_report","tag":"error_report"}}
```
