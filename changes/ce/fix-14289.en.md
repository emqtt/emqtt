Fix log file path issue when importing config from a different environment.

Environment variable `EMQX_LOG_DIR` in docker is `/opt/emqx/log`, but `/var/log/emqx/` when installed from RPM/DEB packages.

Prior to this fix, log file paths (default file handler and audit handler) are environment-variable interpolated when being exported.
This causes the config import to a different environment crash due to the directory being absent.

This fix ensures that the log file paths are not environment-variable interpolated when being exported. It also made sure that the absolute paths log directory from old version export are converted back to environment-variable if the path does not exist in the new environment.
