Fixed data bridge resource update race condition.

In the 'delete + create' process for EMQX resource updates,
long bridge creation times could cause dashboard request timeouts.
If a bridge resource update was initiated before completion of its creation,
it led to an erroneous deletion from the runtime, despite being present in the config file.

This fix addresses the race condition in bridge resource updates,
ensuring the accurate identification and addition of new resources,
maintaining consistency between runtime and configuration file statuses.
