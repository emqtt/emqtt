Improved the placeholder syntax of rule engine.

The parameters of actions support using placeholder syntax to
dynamically fill in the content of strings. The format of the
placeholder syntax is `${key}`.
Before this improvement, the `key` in `${key}` could only contain
letters, numbers, and underscores. Now the `key` supports any UTF8
characters.
