The `packets.publish.dropped` metric was deprecated and replaced by two new, more semantic metrics: `messages.dropped.quota_exceeded` and `messages.dropped.receive_maximum`.  Those are bumped when a message is dropped due to an administrative quota limit being reached (typically number of connections) or the Receive Maximum for the session being reached, respectively.
