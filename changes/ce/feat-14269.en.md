Added `etc/base.hocon` config file.

In this release, we introduced a new configuration file, `etc/base.hocon`, to enhance configuration management and clarity.

Previously, since emqx.conf was the only place for manually crafted configurations, and because it sits at the top-most layer
of the configuration override system, it caused some confusion.
While mutable (not read-only) configurations set in `emqx.conf` could be changed through the UI, API, or CLI and take effect immediately,
those changes would not persist after a node restart — leading to inconsistent behavior.

To address this, we’ve added etc/base.hocon as a foundational configuration layer.
The updated configuration precedence order, from top to bottom, is as follows:

1. Environment variables
2. `etc/emqx.conf`
3. `data/configs/cluster.hocon`
4. `etc/base.hocon`

The `etc/base.hocon` file serves as the base layer for configurations.
While settings defined here can still be modified after the node starts,
this layer ensures consistent override behavior.
