Add two new rule SQL functions `coalesce/2` and `coalesce_ne/2`.

The two functions can help to simplify null-checks in rule SQL.
For example

```
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN is_null(payload.path.to.value) THEN
            0
        ELSE
            payload.path.to.value
    END AS my_value
```

can be as simple as: `SELECT coalesce(payload.path.to.value, 0) AS my_value`.
