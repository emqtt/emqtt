Disabled rule actions now do not trigger `out_of_service` warnings.

Previously, if an action is disabled, there would be a warning log with `msg: out_of_service`,
and the `actions.failed` counter was incremented for the rule.

After this enhancement, disabled action will result in a `debug` level log with `msg: discarded`,
and the newly introduced counter `actions.discarded` will be incremented.
