Fixed the initialization of the HTTP connector state.  When there was incoming traffic being handled by an HTTP action and its underlying connector restarted, cryptic crashes could be seen in the logs mentioning `function_clause`.

Example:

```
20:42:36.850 [error] msg: "resource_exception", info: #{error => {error, function_clause}, id => <<"action:http:a:connector:http:a">>, name => call_query, ...
```
