Fix HTTP authorization request body encoding.

Prior to this fix, the HTTP authorization request body encoding format was taken from the `accept` header.
The fix is to respect the `content-type` header instead.
Also added `access` templating variable for v4 compatibility.
The access code of SUBSCRIBE action is `1` and SUBSCRIBE action is `2`.
