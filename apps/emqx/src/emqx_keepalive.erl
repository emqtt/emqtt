%% from mqtt-v3.1.1 specific
%% A Keep Alive value of zero (0) has the effect of turning off the keep alive mechanism.
%% This means that, in this case, the Server is not required
%% to disconnect the Client on the grounds of inactivity.
%% Note that a Server is permitted to disconnect a Client that it determines
%% to be inactive or non-responsive at any time,
%% regardless of the Keep Alive value provided by that Client.
%%  Non normative comment
%%The actual value of the Keep Alive is application specific;
%% typically this is a few minutes.
%% The maximum value is (65535s) 18 hours 12 minutes and 15 seconds.
