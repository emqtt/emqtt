  The built-in durable storage partitions data into shards.

  Number of identical replicas each shard should have.
  Increasing this number improves durability and availability at the expense of greater resource consumption.
  Quorum of replicas is needed to be healthy for the replication to work, hence an odd number of replicas is a good pick in general.

layout_builtin_wildcard_optimized.label: "Wildcard-optimized storage layout"
layout_builtin_wildcard_optimized.desc:

  _Wildcard-optimized_ layout is designed to maximize the throughput of wildcard subscriptions covering large numbers of topics.

  For example, it can handle scenarios where a very large number of clients publish data to the topics containing their client ID, such as: `sensor/%device-version%/%clientid%/temperature`, `sensor/%device-version%/%clientid%/pressure`, etc.
  This layout will automatically group such topics into a single stream, so a client subscribing to a topic filter containing wildcards (such as `sensor/+/+/temperature`) will be able to consume messages published by all devices as a single batch.

  This layout is efficient for non-wildcard subscriptions as well.~"""

  Wildcard-optimized layout partitions messages recorded at different times into "epochs".
  Reading messages from a single epoch can be done very efficiently, so larger epochs improve the throughput of subscribers, but may increase end-to-end latency.

  Time span covered by each epoch grows exponentially with the value of `epoch_bits`:

  - `epoch_bits = 1`: epoch time = 2 microseconds
